Whether or not to allow to be redirected when received
IKEv2 REDIRECT notify payloads (RFC 5685) in IKE_AUTH
reply (so called connection based redirects). Typical use
case for this is clients-server use case, where the client
is the one receiving the payload and initiating new IKEv2
exchange with the new gateway. Accepted values are
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) meaning never process
any received REDIRECT notify payload and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> meaning always process and
initiate a new connection.
