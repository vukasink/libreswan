IKEv2 REDIRECT mechanism interop test with redirection during
an active session.

west (libreswan) connects to east (strongswan) but is
redirected to north (libreswan) after some time.

??? there is no whack logging of the new IKEv2 exchange in west.console.txt ?
??? there is one XFRM state for east left on west ?
