IKEv2 REDIRECT Mechanism with active redirect with
roadwarriors.

two road warriors, north and road connect to east, shortly after that they are
redirected to west with --redirect whack command.

Disclaimer: it can often happen that tests fails although it in fact did not fail.
east is redirecting north and road almost concurrently and because of the delicate
timing differences it can happen that one is redirected before the other one, leading
to them connecting to west in 'wrong' order, causing inverted console logs and test fail.
