Basic pluto with IKEv2 using X.509 on the responder (east), and Strongswan on
the initiator (west).

This tests libreswan as server accepting rsa-sha1 (v1.5) and rsa-sha2 (PSS)

unfortunately, strongswan per default will response with rsa-sha2 (v1.5) unless
you set  ra_pss = true in strongswan.cond. This test does that.

However, it indicates an unfixable problem. How to migrate strongswan rsa-sha1 clients
to rsa-sha2. strongswan does not support on-the-fly decisions on RSA v1.5 vs RSA PSS
and libreswan does not support RSA v1.5 for all new style RFC 7427 digital signature
methods.

We might be biased, but believe strongswan should fix their code :)
