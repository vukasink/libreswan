IKEv2 REDIRECT Mechanism - testing the 'load-balancing' feature of global-redirect
option.

Let east be 'load-balancer' server, with 3 redirect destination specified in
global-redirect-to option. 1. and 3. redirect destinations are bogus one,
while 2. is the west IP address.

Let north and road simulate multiple road warriors by trying to connect
to east multiple times (after each connection, delete it and add again,
because not deleting it would mean that the server (remote) address will not
be of east in new initiation, but of the server where peer was redirected).

The order of connection initiation is:

north	(should be redirected to 1. redirect destination)
road	(should be redirected to 2. redirect destination - west - connection to west should succeed)
north	(should be redirected to 3. redirect destination)
road	(should be redirected to 1. redirect destination)
north	(should be redirected to 2. redirect destination - west - connection to west should succeed)
