Basic pluto with IKEv2 using PSK on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

This tests for namespace use without configuration include files, but also works when run under kvm

Test extended to also test for PLUTO_BYTES_IN and PLUTO_BYTES_OUT are passed in to updown script.
This was a regression in libreswan 3.30 - 3.32
