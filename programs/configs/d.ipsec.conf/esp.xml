<para> Specifies the algorithms that will be offered/accepted for a Child SA
negotiation. If not specified, a secure set of defaults will be used. Sets
are separated using comma's and pluses.
</para>
<para> The format for ESP is ENC-AUTH followed by one optional PFSgroup. For
instance, "aes_gcm256" or "aes256-sha2_512-dh14" or
"aes-sha2_512+sha2_256". When specifying multiple algorithms, specify the
PFSgroup last, e.g. "aes128+aes256-sha2_512+sha2_256-dh14+dh19".
</para>

<para> The format for AH is AUTH followed by an optional PFSgroup. For
instance, "sha2_512" or "sha2_256-dh14".
</para>
<para>AEAD algorithms such as AES-GCM and AES-CCM don't require separate hashing
algoritm, for example <emphasis remap='I'>esp=aes_gcm256</emphasis> or
<emphasis remap='I'>esp=aes_ccm</emphasis>. Note that the ike= syntax for aes_gcm
does require the prf hashing algorithm which is not needed for esp=.
The supported key sizes for aes_gcm are 128, 192 and 256, which are specified
similarly to plain aes, i.e. <emphasis remap='I'>esp=aes_gcm256</emphasis>. A
subscript of <emphasis remap='I'>_c</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>_b</emphasis>
or <emphasis remap='I'>_a</emphasis> can be used to refer to the different ICV
variants where a means 8 bytes, b means 12 bytes and c means 16 bytes.
The default when not using a subscript is the 16 byte ICV, the recommended
value by RFC-4106 and RFC-8247.
Therefore esp=aes_gcm256 is equivalent to esp=aes_gcm_c256.
It is recommended to migrate to the _c versions (without specifying _c),
as support for smaller ICV's might be removed in the near future.</para>

<para>The supported algorithms depend on the libreswan version, OS and
kernel stack used. Possible ciphers are aes, 3des, aes_ctr, aes_gcm,
aes_ccm, camellia and chacha20_poly1305.</para>

<para>Note that openswan and versions of libreswan up to 3.6 require manually
adding the salt size to the key size. Therefore, to configure an older
version of openswan or libreswan, use: "esp=aes_ccm_c-280-null" to
interop with a new libreswan using "esp=aes_ccm256". For
CCM, the 'keysize' needs to be increased by 24, resulted in valid keysizes
of 152, 215 and 280. For GCM the 'keysize' needs to be increased by 32,
resulting valid 'keysizes' of 160, 224 and 288.
