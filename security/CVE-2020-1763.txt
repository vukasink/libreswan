CVE-2020-1763: Malicious IKEv1 packet can cause libreswan to restart

This alert (and any possible updates) is available at the following URLs:
https://libreswan.org/security/CVE-CVE-2020-1763/

The Libreswan Project was notified by Stephan Zeisberg of Security
Research Labs of a bug in handling bogus encrypted IKEv1 INFORMATIONAL
Exchange packet requests for which there is no state. While building a
log message that the packet has been dropped, a NULL pointer dereference
causes libreswan to crash and restart when it attempts to log the state
name involved.

Vulnerable versions: libreswan 3.27 - 3.31
Not vulnerable     : libreswan 3.32 and newer

Vulnerability information
=========================
In the libreswan code, all IKE packets cause a state change. An added
log message displays the state name on a specific error message for an
IKEv1 Informational Exchange message with a bogus payload for which we
cannot find a valid peer. This message happens when no matching state
is found, and when no state will be created. When looking up the state
name for the log message, this causes a NULL pointer dereference.

Exploitation
============
This vulnerability cannot be abused for a remote code execution or an
authentication bypass. But by continuing to send these packets, a
denial of service attack against the libreswan IKE service is possible.

Workaround
==========
There is no workaround. Please apply one of the patches supplied below.

Credits
=======
This vulnerability was found and reported by Stephan Zeisberg of Security
Research Labs. Stephan also kindly provided the fuzzing packet causing the
crash so we could easilly reproduce this.

Upgrading
=========
To address this vulnerability, please upgrade to libreswan 3.32 or later.
For those who cannot upgrade, patches are provided for libreswan 3.27-3.30
and for 3.31 at the above URL, and are included for reference below.

About libreswan (https://libreswan.org/)
========================================
Libreswan is a free implementation of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
protocols IKEv1 and IKEv2. It is a descendant (continuation fork) of
openswan 2.6.38. IKE is used to establish IPsec VPN connections.

IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide both authentication and
encryption services. These services allow you to build secure tunnels
through untrusted networks. Everything passing through the untrusted
network is encrypted by the IPsec gateway machine, and decrypted by
the gateway at the other end of the tunnel. The resulting tunnel is a
virtual private network (VPN).
