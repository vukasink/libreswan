IKEv2 REDIRECT mechanism with redirection in IKE_AUTH

west wants to connect to east but is redirected to north instead.

normally west has a hardcoded route for eastnet (unrelated to libreswan)
to make testing blocking of unencrypted packets easier. But we cannot have
this route now because we need to send those packets to north instead.
