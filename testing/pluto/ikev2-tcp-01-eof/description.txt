IKEv2 TCP with truncated initial packet + close

West sends an incomplete IKETCP request and then closes the outgoing
stream.  The responder's pluto (east) or the kernel, are then expected
to detect this and shutdown their end of the TCP stream.

Code detecting this needs to look for a 0-byte read (aka EOF) (early
kernels would instead return EAGAIN leading to repeated reads).
